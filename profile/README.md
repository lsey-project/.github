Hello everyone!

I'm excited to introduce you to my personal project, the Lsey Project. This is where I store most of my personal repositories for educational purposes. You might know me by my other names: Alex, gatito, and a few others.

In the Lsey Project, I provide support for Bengal Devices [Board] Feel free to explore and learn with me!

Best regards,
[Alex/Lseything]
